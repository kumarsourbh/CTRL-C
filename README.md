# CTRL-C
CTRL-C is a modular control and computation framework for multi-DOF robotic manipulation systems, integrating hardware design, real-time control algorithms, and software interfaces for precision motion and task execution.

CTRL-C is an ongoing research and development initiative focused on the design and control of high-precision robotic manipulation systems.

The project explores the complete stack of a multi-degree-of-freedom robotic platform, including mechanical architecture, embedded hardware, control algorithms, and software interfaces. Emphasis is placed on modularity, scalability, and real-time performance.

Due to the nature of the work, detailed implementations, datasets, and experimental results are intentionally not公开 at this stage.

## Scope
- Multi-DOF robotic arm design and prototyping
- Embedded control hardware and firmware
- Kinematic and dynamic control algorithms
- System-level software integration
- Human–machine interaction interfaces

## Status
Active development.

## Notes
This repository currently serves as a controlled entry point for documentation, structure, and version tracking. Further details may be released in future iterations.
